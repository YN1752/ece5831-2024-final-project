In this project I trained a U-Net architecture model for detecting tumor regions in the MRI scan images of the brain using Semantic Segmentation. I borrowed the dataset from Kaggle which contains various MRI scan images and data of the tumor region. Mask images were created which is basically creating ground truth images using the segmentation data. Preprocessing techniques were applied before training the model. Final result is a colormap image with detected tumor regions labeled with a different color.
